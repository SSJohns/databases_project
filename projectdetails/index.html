<h1> Team Drop Tables</h1>

<p> An online service that allows people to vote on up and coming bills and this is tracked. Then the app compares your votes to the votes of your representative and senator and sees how consistently they vote in a manner that you would. This would be especially useful for providing pathways for the avergae citizen into the political landscape. It would help congressmen see if they are accurately representing their constituients.</p>

<h2>Usefullness</h2>

<p>There are similar ideas, but there have been no public implementations of the application. So we think that building this idea into reality would be a great step for the congressional tracking process.</p>

<h2>Realness</h2>

<p>A large amount of data on senate is made available by Sunlight Foundation. They have a public api which includes information about how congress votes and who is up for re-election.</p>

<h2>Basic Functions</h2>

<p><ul>
<li>Adding new bills to the bills table and send that information to the users of the app.</li>
<li>Moving a congress persons history of votes if they change office. So if someone in the House moves to the Senate we would make a new table in the senate and combine the old house table to the new senate table. </li>
<li>Remove someones votes if they are removed from office or step down.</li>
<li>Grab bills associated with a senator if they are an author on it</li>
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced Functions</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Associate their voting account with their social media account</li>
<li>We could let people know who they might agree with based on their past voting history.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class = '3 & 7'>Cool Factors</h2>
<p>This is a good idea, because it allows for people to interact with thier congress people in a more significant and less stressful way than they have before. This could allow Congress to be more proactive on deciding when to pass bills for fear that they will be voted out by their now more informed constituents.</p>
